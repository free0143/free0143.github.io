    <p>Artem Zub validated the decision by the Ottawa Senators to sign him as an undrafted free agent to a one-year, entry-level contract May 1, 2020. He scored 14 points (three goals, 11 assists) and averaged 18:23 of ice time as a rookie in 2020-21, and his plus-4 rating was second among Senators defensemen and fifth among Ottawa skaters, and that earned him a two-year contract with the Senators on May 14, 2021.
Prior to joining the NHL, Zub played four seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the Kontinental Hockey League following a trade from Khabarovsk on Dec. 1, 2016. He had two assists in 18 playoff games to help SKA win the 2017 Gagarin Cup. After Zub helped the Olympic Athletes from Russia win gold at the 2018 Pyeong Chang Olympics, he scored a KHL career-high 22 points (13 goals, nine assists) in 57 games in 2019-20.
In addition to Olympic gold, Zub helped Russia finish third at the IIHF World Championship in 2017 and 2019.</p>

<p>The Ottawa Senators (French: Sénateurs d'Ottawa), officially the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club[b] and colloquially known as the Sens, are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa. They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference, and play their home games at the 18,652-seat[4] Canadian Tire Centre, which opened in 1996 as the Palladium.
Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone, the team is the second NHL franchise to use the Ottawa Senators name. The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups,[5] playing in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. On December 6, 1990, after a two-year public campaign by Firestone, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992–93 season.[6] The Senators have made 16 playoff appearances, won four division titles, and won the 2003 Presidents' Trophy. They made an appearance in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.</p>
