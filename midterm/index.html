    Artem Zub validated the decision by the Ottawa Senators to sign him as an undrafted free agent to a one-year, entry-level contract May 1, 2020. He scored 14 points (three goals, 11 assists) and averaged 18:23 of ice time as a rookie in 2020-21, and his plus-4 rating was second among Senators defensemen and fifth among Ottawa skaters, and that earned him a two-year contract with the Senators on May 14, 2021.
Prior to joining the NHL, Zub played four seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the Kontinental Hockey League following a trade from Khabarovsk on Dec. 1, 2016. He had two assists in 18 playoff games to help SKA win the 2017 Gagarin Cup. After Zub helped the Olympic Athletes from Russia win gold at the 2018 Pyeong Chang Olympics, he scored a KHL career-high 22 points (13 goals, nine assists) in 57 games in 2019-20.
In addition to Olympic gold, Zub helped Russia finish third at the IIHF World Championship in 2017 and 2019.
