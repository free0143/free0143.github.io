<p>Hey, I’m <strong>Caz</strong>. I’m an international student from Seattle. I moved to Ottawa in <em>December 5<sup>th</sup>of 2019</em>. I came to Canada to get a better college experience and be able to be more creative in my studies as I graduate to having to live an adult life with a full time job. My dream job is to work in the sports industry as a graphic designer and I still hope to continue playing sports as a part time hobby.</p>
<p2>Sports have always been a big part of my life and playing sports are something I try to do as often as possible. Baseball is my go-to sport and I will either play or watch it when I can. I’ve always had a love for the outdoors and physical activities. Surfing is also another sport that I have fallen in love with since I was young. Whenever I visit a spot where I can surf, I’m surfing any wave I can handle. I always try to push myself to practice more, be better and what I’m doing, but still make it fun at the same time.</p2>
